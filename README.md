## Description

Study of Cosmic Ray Ionization rates given a magnetic field configuration.

## Approach

So the ionization in the pockets will have to be measured considering the number of pockets present in the trajectory.

For a certain number of pockets (Silsbee, 2018), we will have these three populations impacting the ionization within the region. So we have to figure out a way to be able to:

- Identify the pockets on a specific trajectory
- Calculate the respective column densities for forward, backward and mirrored particles.
